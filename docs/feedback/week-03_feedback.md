# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- Top: Agenda added in time and follows template. Mostly clear talking points.
- Tip: Use the Inform / brainstorm / decision making / discuss tags for the talking points to categorize your agenda items. Additionally it is nice to add sub-points to your talking points to add some structure for what is going to be covered.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Top: Overall clear notes and they were merged into the agenda file in a timely manner. An appropriate amount of detail was added in most cases and it is a nice touch to remark what information was given by the TA. Agreements are realistic and actionable.
- Tip: Make sure that the rendering of the notes on gitlab is formatted nicely, for example the action points are all in one line separated by bullets which is difficult to read. Additionally, when applicable assign specific people to the tasks. In this case it would suffice to clean up the formatting and make it clear what is expected of everyone to complete for this week (for example self study, template project working etc), maybe by putting it under one bullet.


#### Chair performance


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- Top: Chair mostly took ownership of the meeting and guided the team through the agenda.
- Tip: Make sure you state clearly that you are opening the meeting, as that is an agenda point. The same goes for closing the meeting, there was some silence between the planned meeting duration point and closing the meeting so another group member seemed to jump in to close the meeting. Also some points were done out of order or skipped, try to stick with the preset order of the agenda and avoid skipping points without mentioning them. For the future, I would recommend adding an agenda item or subpoint to the task distribution talking point to discuss the application, as that was a big discussion that was not present as a specific item in the agenda. In general feel free to redirect the team if they get off task, you are in charge of leading the discussion.


#### Attitude & Relation


Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback: 

- Top: The team took ownership of the meeting and there was a constructive atmosphere. All group members were contributing ideas and asking questions. Team members held a good discussion about the application.



#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: Good

- Top: The team presented a (partially) working UI that allows editing of notes. There was clear progress in back and frontend from last week. The team is on good track.
- Tip: Make sure you are planning ahead for what basic requirements you are fulfilling and have a goal for when you want them completed.

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- Top: Students discussed if goals from last week were reached, all students contributed equally.
- Tip: The team mentioned that there were things they were supposed to do but not what specifically should have been done. Make sure at some point in the meeting you are going around and each group member summarizes what they did in the last week and any issues they encountered, because I don't necessarily know what you were 'supposed to do'.
