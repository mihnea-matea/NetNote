# Meeting


#### Agenda 


Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Top: Individual talking points are clear and include elaboration where necessary about discussion topics. 
- Tip: Use the inform/brainstorm/decision making/discuss tags in your talking points. Make sure that your time estimates are adding up to 45 minutes :)


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker



Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Top: Notes have been merged in a timely manner. I like that most agenda points had notes attached even if there was nothing discussed. 
- Tip: There is a good amount of details, but certain points like "the distribution felt fine, just some individual issues" could be elaborated on further. Additionally for presentation of app to TA you could include notes about the feedback you were given.


#### Chair performance


Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- You took control of the meeting and ensured all topics were covered in an appropriate amount of time. Great job!


#### Attitude & Relation


Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- Everyone was active and involved in discusssion and the atmosphere was constructive. When there were conflicts with meeting times they were discussed and a compromise was reached. You covered a lot of ground in your meeting and everyone was listening to each other, great job!


#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- Top: Application is shippable and there is a lot of progress. There are a few bugs but basic functionality is almost entirely completed, which is good - you guys are on track. Make sure you have the basic functionality done in the next few weeks and then look into HCI and extensions. 
- Tip: Make sure you are still focusing on progress rubrics like tasks and planning and code contributions as those are a large part of the final grade as well. Read the rubrics and make sure the points are met, the key is you are making improvements.



#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- Top: Issues from last week were discussed and it seems like all students are contributing equally. 
- Tip: At the start of the meeting it is very helpful to have each group member talk about what they were in charge of implementing last week and if they were able to complete it/any issues they ran into. This way work distribution and process is clearer for me.
