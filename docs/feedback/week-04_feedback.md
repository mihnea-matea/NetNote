# Meeting


#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- Top: Agenda was added to the repository on time and followed the template.
- Tip: Where applicable you can add sub points to your agenda points to help structure what you are going to discuss. I see some of the tags were included in the talking points, but feel free to add them more explicitly for each talking point, for example you could tag the point 'task distribution' as decision making.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker


Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback: 

- Top: Notes are merged into the agenda file and contain an appropriate amount of detail. There are clear agreements and each group members assigned work for the week is included in the notes. I liked that you remarked on any skipped meeting points as well. Overall really good job!


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback: 

- Top: All topics of the agenda were covered in an appropriate amount of time. I liked how you brought others into the conversation by having each member discuss what they are working on for this meeting.


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Very Good

Feedback: 

- Top: Well done, you guys took great ownership and all members were active and involved in the discussion. You are all listening to and asking for each other's opinions and the atmosphere is constructive.


#### Potentially Shippable Product


Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- Top: You have a shippable product and have made progress from last week. You are on track.
- Tip: Make sure that by next meeting you are able to save the notes to the server and have made concrete progress on the basic requirements, saving entities to the database is an essential part of the application and required for a lot of the other functionality to be implemented/work correctly.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Good 

Feedback: 

- Top: The action list/completed items of last week were discussed. Contribution and workload distribution is fair. I liked how each member described what they were working on for this week.
- Tip: At the beginning of the meeting when going through action items/work done last week, also have each person say what they did, this is a helpful recap and makes sure that each member is contributing. If someone ran into issues when implementing their tasks from last week they can also bring it up at this point.
